# Problem 1

This problem is about dealing with compound data structures. In the starting materials, there is a file called `space_missions.json` which has a variety of information about various fictional space missions, including what crew were on that mission and what hardware was tested as part of the mission. Your objectives are as follows:

- Read in the JSON data into your Python program for use
- Write a function that takes the data and then returns the number of _different_ crew members that have `"EVA"` certification and have served on missions that begin with an 'A'.
- Write a function that returns all of the unique mission names where the Navigation hardware, on average, reported diagnostic values of more than 100 W.
